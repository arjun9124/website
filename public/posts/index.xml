      <title>Casio DB-36 Inverted Display Mod</title>

      <description>I had been meaning to try an inverted display mod on one of my Casio watches, and now finally I had the time and money to get a polarizing filer and do it and see for myself&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;
time&amp;hellip;.. with the reversed polarity.
In simple terms this mod i.e. modification basically takes the display, and inverts its colours. Now what does that do ? It makes me a cooler person. It is acheived by removing the old polarizing filter and putting on a new filter that blocks and allows the opposite directions of polarized light, generating this effect.</description>

      <description>A series of (incoherent) thoughts I have had since joining college. The curiculum is merely a carcass every student is assigned to drag behind them for the next four years of their life. Even the administration knows this, and they dont put too much effort into not letting the world know about it.
Exams and academics only exist to provide a goal to those who dont have a purpose to live upto (yet).</description>

      <description>So my first JEE attempt is complete and now I am here, writing a blog post in a (sucessfull) attempt of relaxing and chilling for one day in what seems like months since I have walked without a head full of stress. This I belive must be my reward. The only proof that I need to strengthen this belife is that today, ladies and gentlemen is the day when the south western monsoon finally arrived here in Delhi.</description>

      <description>This post was originally made on my blogger blog on 01/04/2022. In this post, I shall be expressing my newfound appreciation of Pixel art.
Personally, I have always been a fan of old 90&amp;rsquo;s graphics and retro computing in general. Old 90&amp;rsquo;s graphics, although a compromise made by the artists for the days low graphics memory have in this age become something people appreciate. Afterall, it still is an art. And what an art !</description>

      <title>Wearing A Mechanical Watch</title>

      <description>This article was made on my old blog on 17 February 2022.
Having worn almost all sorts of watches, around a month ago I finally decided to make the leap to a mechanical watch. This leap of mine which truly felt like a leap of faith in the beginning, was a lot more reliable than I had expected it to be.
The one thing that attracted me towards a mechanical watch is the fact that it has life.</description>

The perfect north Indian breakfast, not just north Indian though. Parantha is a thing that possibly is the largest common tie between one of the largest regions of this sub continent. From Lahore to Calcutta, you can see the similar breakfast of parantas with chai. And why not !? isn&amp;rsquo;t it such a great one.</description>

      <title>The Only Day Your Dad Will Ever Ask You To Watch TV</title>

Republic Day, its like the only time of the year when your dad asks you to watch TV. Or shall I say that wants you to watch TV with him. For all my life republic day has always been a father son moment type of a thing. Spotting celebrity faces in the republic day crowd, to guessing the aircraft names during fly-by&amp;rsquo;s, and having the annual moment where the Arjun tank comes on screen during the parade (and my dad has to specifically inform me about it&amp;rsquo;s arrival) has always kind of been how I&amp;rsquo;ve had and seen Republic Day.</description>
