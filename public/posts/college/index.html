<h1>College</h1>

Jan. 28, 2023

<h2 id="a-series-of-incoherent-thoughts-i-have-had-since-joining-college">A series of (incoherent) thoughts I have had since joining college.</h2>
<p>The curiculum is merely a carcass every student is assigned to drag behind them for the next four years of their life. Even the administration knows this, and they dont put too much effort into not letting the world know about it.<br>
Exams and academics only exist to provide a goal to those who dont have a purpose to live upto (yet).<br>
Extra-curricular activites exist, yet as a curriculum themselves. The creative outlet of extra-curricular activies is just reduced to gaining credentials to add after ones name on their resume. Perhaps a form of totalitarianism, imposed by their political correctness. Giving us the freedom to have such collectives yet also prioritizing our careers and placements. Making it much harder to rebel against them. It is easy to rebel against tyranny but tough to rebel against the conformism enforced by the very freedom of choice. It is tough to realise when some granted freedoms of extra-curricular activites become the slaveries of imposed curriculum. This brings me to the question, shall we ever be truly free ? I tried to fit in, infact if it has been noticed this webpage was reskinned (shall I say stripped of skin, or soul). For the purposes of looking more professional, to be more squared for professional life I had butchred my own creativity. Now that I have realised the status quo, I am no longer afraid of offending people by merely being not squared. This is some paranoia</p>

                                                                                                                          (((YOU)))

<p>Materialism is the end goal of everything, nothing is purely creative. One might look at it saying that materialism is the goal and creative satisfaction is only a byproduct, the college is only the means.</p>
<p>Books are too old, big and boring to study. They arent really needed for tests that are to be aced just once. The books dont match pace with out fast paced world, there is too much information in the air already. Nobody needs an explanation, just give us the short notes.</p>
<p><strong>The library</strong> seems eeiry to me. Especially seeing how the engineering textbooks remain untouched.<br>
Some books have been here since the 60&rsquo;s some since the 70&rsquo;s. Finding a book about model trains that was last issued by someone in 1978 brought up a lot of emotions in me. Creativity, free expression lies in dusty corners, neglected since ages. Once practiced by someone.</p>
<p>**Cameras&hellip;..**cameras everywhere, every moment is to be captured. Maybe to make others feel envious of the college-goer&rsquo;s sheer random luck that he applied for this college out of 16000 others because he had heard its name.<br>
Do not live in the moment, capture it for later.</p>
<p><strong>passion&hellip;.s</strong>लोग पोलिटिकल करेक्टनेस, या मेरी आधुनिक प्राकृत भाषा में &ldquo;राजनैतिक यथार्थता&rdquo; के कारण अक्सर कहते है की &ldquo;follow your dreams&rdquo; &ldquo;passion के पीछे भागो।&rdquo; अपनी इच्छा के अनुसार अपने जीवन की राह पकड़ो। और इसके साथ ही आपके इच्छाओं के विरुद्ध जाने वाली परिस्थितियों/व्यक्तिओं /संस्थाओं की निंदा करते है। परन्तु, कहूंगा कहित passion के विपरीत का कर देंखे। क्या पता आपको कोई नया पैशन मिल जाए।</p>
<p>apologies for the नकारात्मकता.</p>
<p>2023-May-Something : My initial nihilism for college has now faded as I have learnt more about the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;</p>
