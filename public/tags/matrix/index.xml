      <description>I had been meaning to try an inverted display mod on one of my Casio watches, and now finally I had the time and money to get a polarizing filer and do it and see for myself&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&#xA;time&amp;hellip;.. with the reversed polarity.&#xA;In simple terms this mod i.e. modification basically takes the display, and inverts its colours. Now what does that do ? It makes me a cooler person. It is acheived by removing the old polarizing filter and putting on a new filter that blocks and allows the opposite directions of polarized light, generating this effect.</description>

      <description>This post was originally made on my blogger blog on 01/04/2022. In this post, I shall be expressing my newfound appreciation of Pixel art.&#xA;Personally, I have always been a fan of old 90&amp;rsquo;s graphics and retro computing in general. Old 90&amp;rsquo;s graphics, although a compromise made by the artists for the days low graphics memory have in this age become something people appreciate. Afterall, it still is an art. And what an art !</description>
