      <description>This post was originally made on my blogger blog on 01/04/2022. In this post, I shall be expressing my newfound appreciation of Pixel art.
Personally, I have always been a fan of old 90&amp;rsquo;s graphics and retro computing in general. Old 90&amp;rsquo;s graphics, although a compromise made by the artists for the days low graphics memory have in this age become something people appreciate. Afterall, it still is an art. And what an art !</description>
