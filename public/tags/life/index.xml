      <description>Music, Mathematics and The Matrix&#xA;Earphones are like parasites. Parasites that crawl up your ear to disconnect you from the reality to hook you up to the fake world of digital entertainment stimulating your senses shielding you from the truth you are trying to run away from. Remember that old Moserbear advertisement ?&#xA;Don&#39;t like to think too much It makes me think too much It keeps my mind on my mind Don&#39;t want to see too much It makes me see too much Sometimes I&#39;d rather be blind Music itself is a very powerful thing.</description>

      <description>A series of (incoherent) thoughts I have had since joining college. The curiculum is merely a carcass every student is assigned to drag behind them for the next four years of their life. Even the administration knows this, and they dont put too much effort into not letting the world know about it.&#xA;Exams and academics only exist to provide a goal to those who dont have a purpose to live upto (yet).</description>

      <title>The Only Day Your Dad Will Ever Ask You To Watch TV</title>

      <description>This post was originally published on 27 January 2022 on my old blog. This is a revised version of the post.&#xA;Republic Day, its like the only time of the year when your dad asks you to watch TV. Or shall I say that wants you to watch TV with him. For all my life republic day has always been a father son moment type of a thing. Spotting celebrity faces in the republic day crowd, to guessing the aircraft names during fly-by&amp;rsquo;s, and having the annual moment where the Arjun tank comes on screen during the parade (and my dad has to specifically inform me about it&amp;rsquo;s arrival) has always kind of been how I&amp;rsquo;ve had and seen Republic Day.</description>
