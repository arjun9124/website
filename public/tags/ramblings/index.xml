      <description>Music, Mathematics and The Matrix&#xA;Earphones are like parasites. Parasites that crawl up your ear to disconnect you from the reality to hook you up to the fake world of digital entertainment stimulating your senses shielding you from the truth you are trying to run away from. Remember that old Moserbear advertisement ?&#xA;Don&#39;t like to think too much It makes me think too much It keeps my mind on my mind Don&#39;t want to see too much It makes me see too much Sometimes I&#39;d rather be blind Music itself is a very powerful thing.</description>

      <description>Its the conflicting flavours, red caramelized chutney with its heavy spicy taste and the green, sour tangy refreshing coriander chutney. The hot tikki just out of the wok, straight into some chilled yoghurt. A contrast of temperature. The depth and texture of the brown deep fried tikki being contrasted by the homogenous white yoghurt. On top it may be graced by a salad dressing, of chopped onions, cabbage and pomegranate further producing opposition to the deep fried carbohydrates of the tikki.</description>

      <description>A series of (incoherent) thoughts I have had since joining college. The curiculum is merely a carcass every student is assigned to drag behind them for the next four years of their life. Even the administration knows this, and they dont put too much effort into not letting the world know about it.&#xA;Exams and academics only exist to provide a goal to those who dont have a purpose to live upto (yet).</description>
