      <title>चर्चा</title>

      <description>बात होती है तो केवल उसकी जो स्पष्ट रूप से सभी की इंद्रियों में पंजिकृत (बहतर शब्द की गैर मौजूदगी में।) हो। तापमान, वायु का रुख, कुत्तों का भौंकना, विविद्ध प्रकार की गंधें वगैरा इस वार्तालाप के लिए उत्तम विष्य हैं। अपने निजी दर्षन इस चर्चा में न ही लायें तो अच्छा है। मालूम नहीं कब कोई छोटी सी टिप्पणी या राय आऐगी और माहौल को एक तनाव से भर देगी। एसा तनाव जो स्वयं को शंका के घेरे में दाल देगा, कि कहीं आप ही तो किसी प्रकार के अधर्मी नहीं?</description>

      <description>Music, Mathematics and The Matrix&#xA;Earphones are like parasites. Parasites that crawl up your ear to disconnect you from the reality to hook you up to the fake world of digital entertainment stimulating your senses shielding you from the truth you are trying to run away from. Remember that old Moserbear advertisement ?&#xA;Don&#39;t like to think too much It makes me think too much It keeps my mind on my mind Don&#39;t want to see too much It makes me see too much Sometimes I&#39;d rather be blind Music itself is a very powerful thing.</description>

      <description>A series of (incoherent) thoughts I have had since joining college. The curiculum is merely a carcass every student is assigned to drag behind them for the next four years of their life. Even the administration knows this, and they dont put too much effort into not letting the world know about it.&#xA;Exams and academics only exist to provide a goal to those who dont have a purpose to live upto (yet).</description>

      <description>So my first JEE attempt is complete and now I am here, writing a blog post in a (sucessfull) attempt of relaxing and chilling for one day in what seems like months since I have walked without a head full of stress. This I belive must be my reward. The only proof that I need to strengthen this belife is that today, ladies and gentlemen is the day when the south western monsoon finally arrived here in Delhi.</description>

      <title>The Only Day Your Dad Will Ever Ask You To Watch TV</title>
      <link>https://cipirit.netlify.app/posts/republic-day/</link>

      <description>This post was originally published on 27 January 2022 on my old blog. This is a revised version of the post.&#xA;Republic Day, its like the only time of the year when your dad asks you to watch TV. Or shall I say that wants you to watch TV with him. For all my life republic day has always been a father son moment type of a thing. Spotting celebrity faces in the republic day crowd, to guessing the aircraft names during fly-by&amp;rsquo;s, and having the annual moment where the Arjun tank comes on screen during the parade (and my dad has to specifically inform me about it&amp;rsquo;s arrival) has always kind of been how I&amp;rsquo;ve had and seen Republic Day.</description>
