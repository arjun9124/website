      <description>So my first JEE attempt is complete and now I am here, writing a blog post in a (sucessfull) attempt of relaxing and chilling for one day in what seems like months since I have walked without a head full of stress. This I belive must be my reward. The only proof that I need to strengthen this belife is that today, ladies and gentlemen is the day when the south western monsoon finally arrived here in Delhi.</description>

      <title>The Only Day Your Dad Will Ever Ask You To Watch TV</title>

      <description>This post was originally published on 27 January 2022 on my old blog. This is a revised version of the post.
Republic Day, its like the only time of the year when your dad asks you to watch TV. Or shall I say that wants you to watch TV with him. For all my life republic day has always been a father son moment type of a thing. Spotting celebrity faces in the republic day crowd, to guessing the aircraft names during fly-by&amp;rsquo;s, and having the annual moment where the Arjun tank comes on screen during the parade (and my dad has to specifically inform me about it&amp;rsquo;s arrival) has always kind of been how I&amp;rsquo;ve had and seen Republic Day.</description>
