# The Point Of No Return

Fuck it. 
Its no point studying now. Its quite interesting that I've appeared for the most difficult and challenging courses of my life with close to no preperation, and I am still expecting a good score. 

Whats wrong in expecting though ? For mathematics I can still say, its a usefull tool that will be required by me across all of my engineering. But the physics ? Oh really that is an entirely useless subject, or seems to be alteast.
