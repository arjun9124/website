Fuck it. 
Its no point studying now. Its quite interesting that I've appeared for the most difficult and challenging courses of my life with close to no preparation, and I am still expecting a good score. 

What's wrong in expecting though ? For mathematics I can still say, its a useful tool that will be required by me across all of my engineering. But the physics ? Oh really that is an entirely useless subject, or seems to be at least.  What is the point forcing everyone to learn something, when it may only be useful to a very specific few.  Fermi-Dirac, Maxwell-Boltzmann, I am familiar with these names. As for what they did I have no idea.  It was while watching a documentary on Oppenheimer I found the magnitude and the importance of their discoveries, while I still didn't really knew what they had done.
