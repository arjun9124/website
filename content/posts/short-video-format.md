## Against the short video format

The short video format is a non consensual, habit forming, freedom infringing video format that destroys the users attention span. It takes away the users right to consent, delivers them trivial information in bite sized bits of novelty along with a hit of hormones. 

The user while viewing this format loose all their freedom of choice, as videos scroll past them automatically without any decision making involved. 

This method of content delivery where the user is blind to what they may be seeing next is based on the same reward mechanisms as gambling. 

These videos often show people doing activities which involve some form of creation, or contain videogame voiceovers. The purpose of these is to produce parasocial agency. By producing parasocial agency, the video makes the person believe that they are in fact doing something productive and provides them with a sense of accomplishment by seeing a simple yet "satisfying" task be completed in front of themselves smoothly without any holdups. This small SOA is provided to them without any form of physical suffering, or effort not even so much as a scroll or a tap as the algorithm picks and chooses the best content to keep the user hooked.

To conclude, it can be said that this video format produces little to no good for the user and should be replaced by better harmless formats.
