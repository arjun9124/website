 Its the conflicting flavours, red caramelized chutney with its heavy spicy taste and the green, sour tangy  refreshing coriander chutney. The hot tikki just out of the wok, straight into some chilled yoghurt. A contrast of temperature. The depth and texture of the brown deep fried tikki  being contrasted by the homogenous white yoghurt. On top it may be graced by a salad dressing, of chopped onions, cabbage and pomegranate further producing opposition to the deep fried carbohydrates of the tikki.
 
 And perhaps the most important, the dahi serving as a ubiquitous homogenous medium for everything, an euphemism for the universal ether that surrounds us. This white dahi also serves as an empty canvas for the confluence of the green and the red, representing our eternal battle between chaos and order, Ying and Yang. As we proceed to eat the tikki, the fluids are mixed, the order of the boundaries is broken and we are left with this high entropy slop with no unique taste of its own, but a sensory overload. Inside this slop, we have the tikki representing life itself.

It is up to the consumer, the human to maintain this strict balance between order and chaos, so that his tikki, his life isn't lost in entropy. 

> Tikki ? Where's the tikki and salad dressing Excuse me U can't just have dahi chatni and chaos

The dahi, the ethereal fluid is representative of the universe, the chutneys act as agents of change representing the battle of chaos and order the salad, the tikki serve as the ethereal bodies representing life, death, and meaning. The tikki in itself, is representative of the battle of maximalism and minimalism, chaos and order, male and female, hokuto and nanto.
