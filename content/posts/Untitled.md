_Music, Mathematics and The Matrix_

	 Don't like to think too much
	It makes me think too much
	It keeps my mind on my mind
	Don't want to see too much
	It makes me see too much
	Sometimes I'd rather be blind

Earphones are like parasites. Parasites that crawl up your ear to disconnect you from the reality to hook you up to the fake world of digital entertainment stimulating your senses shielding you from the truth you are trying to run away from. Remember that old Moserbear advertisement ? Music itself is a very powerful thing. You see something bad you can close your eyes, you smell something you can hold your breath but if you hear something you didn’t want to, you cannot close your ears. Hearing like other senses cannot be cut off. Perhaps this is why music was considered blasphemous for a really long while across many cultures. Music can simulate feelings, like to take a drug one must consent, to smell a compound one must consent, but music doesn’t need any. From sadness to euphoria, music can take one to many places. And that’s why know what you’re listening to. Music is a powerful tool and it should be handled with care. 

	All the things that they're saying and doing  
	When they pass me by it just fills me up with noise  
	It overloads me  
	I wanna disconnect myself  
	Pull my brain stem out and unplug myself  
	I want nothing right now, I want to pull it out


*stuff about music here*


	Yeah, I want to pull it out, yeah  
	I wanna break it all down, hey, I wanna pull it out  
	Yeah, yeah, disconnect myself, disconnect myself  
	I wanna see it go down, yeah, disconnect myself

My mathematics 101 professor would often remark in his idealism, that while learning a student must surrender himself completely to the teacher, mindfully, soulfully, bodily in every way possible. To his morality this was spiritual, this was how he had learnt. To our perverted minds this was funny.  

	A thousand miles an hour going nowhere fast  
	Clinging to the details of your past  
	Talking 'bout your damage and you're wasting my time  
	  
	Wanna be the king of pain? Stand in line  
	All the numbers and the colors and the facts  
	Backed by the rumors and the figures and the stats  
	I think I'm gonna download my mind

While he did show some narcissism, of which he was well aware (and deserving) he was perhaps one of the best professors I have ever encountered all my years of learning till yet. The best way to study from a teacher like him was to surrender. To devote all your attention to the man in front of you and his whiteboard. Unfortunately, our minds were not only perverted but also attention deficit. The only things our minds could surrender themselves to was the escapism of media. The exchange of knowledge with a person of his level was simply not possible. 

	Too damn bad if at the end of the day the only thoughts  
	In your brain are all the things that they say, what a waste  
	Too damn bad if at the end of the line you got no idea of  
	What's on your own mind  
	You got no one to blame but yourself  
	Too much to know, too much to see  
	If I mean something to you but it's nothing to me  
	It's just another ad for someone's version of how they think   you should be
