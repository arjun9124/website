So my first JEE attempt is complete and now I am here, writing a blog post in a (sucessfull) attempt of relaxing and chilling for one day in what seems like months since I have walked without a head full of stress. This I belive must be my reward. The only proof that I need to strengthen this belife is that today, ladies and gentlemen is the day when the south western monsoon finally arrived here in Delhi.

_A pretty good opportunnity to relax_

Ah what could be better than that. And here I am, sitting in my balcony. I havent stepped inside this whole day. Coming to my jee, the test was good. I dont know if it was my lazy arse filling the application form when the deadline was nearing or the randomized center allotment that I got my center alloted to me in the opposite side of Delhi. Which to the delight of my bored JEEtard self came with a one hour long drive across Delhi. Now going out is something that I have rarely done in the last two or three years, and then a drive across most of Delhi that's... overwhelming. Floks, I'd purposefully fill my applications late just so that go out on a little drive. Since the center was located Jamuna paar (across the yamuna) I even got the chance to see the newly built Superior bridge (newly built after a decade or so of construction and delays). Unfortunatley I couldnt click any pics, but I would have loved to. Thankfully the center that was alloted to me was in a decent location with decent facilites by which I mean that they had a little AC in the examination hall.

Now I had never expected myself to be so chilled out while giving JEE.** For a person who was having stress induced headaches back in November that he's going to flunk JEE and ruin his career, I was astoundingly chill.** It was almost akward that me with what little I have prepared I was still confident that I am going to give the exam while others around me were consoling and probably trying to motivate me that "dude dont worry just go in give the test you're gonna do well I tell you" It was pretty tough explaining to them that guys It's allright, I doing good its going to go great. I woke up at 5:30 that day unlike my regular 0500 Hours. Since I had been alloted the second shift I still had a lot of time to revise formulas for one last time before the test. I pretty much arrived at the center on time, and man the experience from the entry gates to the examination room is one ride. First they check your papers at the gate during the entry and then they let you in. Once you're in you go through a series of checks, first is the guy who rechecks all your papers, takes away your mask gives you a new one and checks your "ears". Yes, they check your ears, just in case some son of a james bond doesn't sneak in a air pod or two trying to cheat. Then they have you take off your shoes to check that you aren't carrying any sophesticated cheating devices which may include, bits of paper. Then they perform a manual check on you. After which you're let in then you step into a room where they click your picture and put a tag on your wrist and send you for your examinaton hall. So thereafter I went to my examination hall, I still remember the numbers that guy wrote that I had to take the help of a security guard to deciper 5206-BKA-143. Room 5206, Computer 143. I found the room and frantically looked for computer 143, and to my surprise I was welcomed by a square, yes square not 16:9 not 4:3 but a square LCD monitor with my name and my pictures on it. The one submitted with the admit card and the one that was clicked downstairs at the checkpost as I may call it. Pretty neah huh. As I looked around, I saw weird golden briefcases hooked to the lab's LAN, probably providing the interface for the test. And talk of the lab! the lab I got placed in was the one alloted to the ECE students of that college.

The seat I was alloted was a corner seat and was pretty airy, I was chilling in the examination center to the point that even the invigilator had to check me out twice that whats wrong with this kid. Now I dont know if it were my self diagnosed ADHD (probably not) or just me being pretty relaxed that made me start rocking and swinging in my chair.

Coming to the test, It wasn't anything exceptional. I think did pretty well in physics, maths wasn't bad either. I could have done a bit better in chemistry though.

Now all's well that ends well, this attempt of JEE wasn't my best surely but wasn't the last either. Hopefully I'd do a bit better at the next attempt whenever I have it. Untill then, I guess stay put folks. I'll try to survive too.
