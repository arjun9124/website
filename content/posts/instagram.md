I havent had an instagram account for over a year, and even when I had one I rarely used it. Not keeping an instagram account for me is more of a political statement than a social one. And I would like to illustrate this in the same passive aggressive fasion which seems to be becoming this blog's staple.

1. Privacy

2. Designed to draw attention 

3. You just cant delete your account like that
