Hi, I am Arjun. I live in Delhi, India. I am currently in that awkward phase in life where you have spent about two years in college and haven't entirely figured out what to do, are anxious about the direction you are taking, and are pretty sure you've messed up somewhere down the line and it is getting back to you. I am a student of Engineering.  

## What's the deal with this website ?

* It's [minimalist.](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) Or so it seems. 

* It's my medium of self expression on the web.

* It's where I post my stuff, I don't have any social media accounts.
